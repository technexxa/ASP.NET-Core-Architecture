> **What Is Vertical Slice Architecture**
>
> The vertical slice architecture is a technique that helps us build maintainable applications by separating the application around features or “vertical slices”.
>
> In this approach, we think of the application code in terms of features rather than the layer it sits in. We treat each feature as a vertical slice. Because every feature within the application is a separate component, it can change independently.
>
> Advantages of Vertical Slice Architecture:
>
> - Reduction in Coupling
> - External Interaction
> - Command and Query Responsibility Segregation
> - Feature Grouping
